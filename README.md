# SvelteUI Official CLI

## **The cli will be written in Rust ðŸ¦€.**

This CLI as of now (04/30/22) will be used for scaffolding new projects, and creating boilerplate code for the consumer.

If more/better ideas are thought of, I am all ears.

Having the cli written in rust is a very interesting choice, but I believe it has many benefits

Such as speed, safety, efficiency (boring rust stuff).

Not only that though, it allows for non JS/TS dev's to contribute to SvelteUI in some way.

Or even those who are just interested in trying something new out
